# S3 101  
### The Basics:  
- S3 is Object-based: i.e. allows you to upload files   
- Files can be up to 5 TB   
- Unlimited storage    
- Files are stored in buckets (similar to folders)   
- S3 is a universal namespace; names must be unique globally    
- If you uploade a file you will recieve a HTTP 200 code if successful    
- Build for 99.99% availability for the S3 platrfom    
- Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability    
- Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999% durability for S3 information (11 * 9)    
- Tiered Storage Avaiable    
- Lifecycle Management     
- Versioning    
- Encryption          
- Secure your data - access control list or bucket policies  
## Data Consistency Model   
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects (new objects available immediately)   
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETS (can take some time to propogate   
## Simple Key Value Store   
- Key (Name of object)  
- Value (The Data - seqence of bytes)  
- Version ID - important for versioning . 
- Metadata  
- Subresources - bucket-specific configuation:   
    - Bucket Policies, Access control Lists
    - Cross Origin Resouce Sharing (CORS) 
    - Transfer Acceleration   
### Storage Tiers / Classes     
- S3 99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilies and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 faciliies concurrently    
- S3 - IA: Infrequently accessed.  For Data that is acess less frequentl, but requires rapid access when needed.  Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee      
- S3 - One Zone IA: Same as IA however data is stored in a single Availability Zone only.  Cost is 205 less than regular S3 - IA      
- Reduced Redundancy Storage: S      
- Glacier: Very cheap, but used for archival only.  Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and it takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier    
**S3 - Intelligent Tiering** 
- Unknown or unpredictable access patterns
- 2 tiers: frequent and infrequent access
- Automatically moves your data to most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object   
-- If an object is not accessed for 30 days it is moved to infrequently access tier   
- Good way to optimize costs   
- No fees for accessing your data but a small monthly fee for monitoring / automation $0.0025 per 1,000 objects  
### Charges   
- Storage per GB    
- Requests (Get, Put, Copy, etc)
- Storage Mgmt Pricing: Inventory, Analytics and Object Tags
- Data Mgmt Pricing: Data transferred out of S3   
- Transfer Acceleration: Use of CloudFront to optimize transfers   
## Exam Tips    
- Object Based: Files only   
# S3 Security   
- By default, all newly created buckers are PRIVATE   
- You can set up acces control to your buckets using  
    - Bucket Policies - Applied at bucket level (written in JSON)  
    - Access Control Lists - Applied at an object level 
- S3 buckets can be configured to create accsss logs, which log all requests made to the S3 bucket.  These logs can be written to another bucket.   
# S3 Encryption 
1) In Transit:   
 - SSL / TLS (Transport Layer Security) - HTTPS protocol
2) At Rest:   
 - Server Side Encryption:  
    - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
    - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys, SSE-KMS
    - Servers Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C
3) Client Side Encryption   
### Enforcing Encryption on S3 Buckets   
- Every time a file is uploaded to S3, a PUT request is initiated.     
- If the file is to be encrypted at upload time, the *x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter* will be included in the request header   
- Two options available:     
    - **x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256** (SSE-S3 - S3 managed keys)   
    - **x-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms** (SSE-KMS - KMS managed keys)    
- When this parame3ter is included in trhe header of the PUT request, it tells S3 to encrypt the objet at the time of upload, using the specified encryption method.   
- You can enforce the use of Server Side Encryption by using a Bucket Policy which denies any S3 PUT request which doesn't include the **x-amz-server-side-encryption** parameter in the request header.    
# CloudFront   
**CDN:** A content delivery network is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.   
### Key Terminology   
- **Edge Location** - This is the location wehre content is cached and can also be written.  Separate to an AWS Region/AZ.   
- **Origin** - This is the origin of all the files that the CSN will distribute.  Origins can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or Route53.   
- *Distribution* - This is the name given to the CDN, which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.    
  1) **Web Distribution** - Typically used for websites (HTTP / HTTPS)
  2) **RTMP: Real Time Messaging Protocol** - Used for Media Streaming / Flash multi-media content 
### What is CloudFront   
Amazon CloudFront can be used to deliver you entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using a global netowrk of edge locations.  Requets for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with teh best possible performance.   
- e.g. Can be used to optimize performance for users accessing a website backed by S3.   
### CloudFront and S3 Transfer Acceleration   
Amazon S3 Transfer Accelearation enables fast, easy an seure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.   
Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations.  As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.    
## Exam Tips   
- Edge locations are not just READ only - you can WRITE to them too.   
- CloudFront Edge Locations aree utilised by S3 Transfer Acceleration to reduce latency for S3 uploads   
- Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live)    
- You can clear cached objects but will be charged   
# CloudFront Lab  
Signed URLs or Signed Cookies are a way to limit access to content via CloudFront for only selected users - i.e. paid for content     
WAF: Web Application Firewals - traffic filtereing for SQL injecting or Cross Site Scripting.  This is protection at the application layer.   
# S3 Performance Optimization   
S3 is designed to support very high request rates.  However, if your S3 buckets are routinely receiving > 100 PUT / LIST / DELETE or >300 GET requests per second, then there are some best practice guidelines that will help optimize S3 performance.   **GET-Intensive Workloads** - use CloudFront content delivery service to get best performance.  CloudFront will cache your most frequently acc3ssed objects and will reduce latency for your GET requests.   
**Mixed Request Type Workloads** - A mix of GET, PUT, DELETE - the key names you use wof ryour objects can impact performance for intensive workloads.   
    - S3 uses the key name to determine which partition an object will be stored in  
    - The use of sequential key names e.g. names prefixed with a time stamp or alphabetical sequences increases the likelihoood of having multiple objects stored on the sam3 partition.    
    - For heavy workloads this can cause I/O issues and contention    
    - By using a random prefix to key names, you can force S3 to distribute your keys across multiple partitions, distributing the I/O workload.    
## Exam Tips
Remember the 2 main approaches to Performance Optimization for S3:    
    1) GET-Intensive Workloads - Use CloudFront   
    2) Mixed-Workloads - Avoid sequential key names or your S3 objects.  Instead, add a random prefix like a hex hash to the key name to prevent multiple objects from being stored on the same partition.    
### NOTES
In July 2018, Amazon announced a massive increase in S3 performance:    
- 3.5k put requests per second   
- 5.5k get requests .  
This new performance negates the previous guidance to randomize object keynames.  Logical and sequential naming patters can now be used without performance implications.   
# S3 Summary   
### S3 CORS    
- Used to enable cross origin access for your AWS resources   
- By default, resources in one bucket cannot access resources located in another   
- To allow this we need to configure CORS on the bucket being accesssed and enbale access for the origin (bucket) attempting to access
